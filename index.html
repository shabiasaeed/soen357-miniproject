  			<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
  			<p>Quebec is gradually reverting to life before the COVID-19 outbreak after dealing with the pandemic for almost three years. It is impossible to overlook the aftereffects of COVID-19 and how they continue to affect us even as COVID-19 nears its end. The people of Quebec have observed that many products have grown more expensive due to inflation as they attempt to get their lives back to normal after the pandemic. In an attempt to lessen the negative effects of high inflation, the government of Quebec has recruited our team to create an app for the restaurant "Flavors", which is situated in the center of downtown and is close to Concordia University. After extensive investigation and analysis of the effects of inflation, it was determined that the ideal solution would be an addition of a cashback feature to the app.</p>

  			<p>The user personas were divided into three groups based on the research information our team gathered to better understand the demands of the users. Following a thorough examination of each group, we found that user requirements vary greatly depending on each person's priorities, ambitions, skills, and frustration.</p>

                  <p><b>Persona #1:</b> Our first persona, Olivia Grayson, is a hard-working employee who spends the majority of her time at her office located downtown. Olivia loves sitting and talking with her friends, as she isn’t able to do that often with her demanding work schedule. Olivia is an adamant believer that food brings people together and enjoys bonding with friends and family over a delicious meal. Olivia aims to treat her friends and family every so often by placing big orders from an online delivery app, in hopes of earning rewards.</p>
                  <p><b>Persona #2:</b> The second persona, Martins James, works at a local accounting firm and because of his hectic and unpredictable schedule, meal planning isn’t his priority. Martins is very selective of the food he eats, and he frequently finds himself meticulously reviewing ratings before placing any orders. As an accountant, Martins tends to be frugal when spending his own money, hence, he would like to save money on his orders.</p>
                  <p><b>Persona #3:</b> Finally, our third persona is Isabella . Isabella is an international student from Turkey who is currently completing her second year of Software Engineering at Concordia University. Isabella is a full-time student, who spends a majority of her time attending lectures and commuting to school. As a result, Isabella finds adjusting to life in Canada challenging because she has no family to rely on and must cook and care for herself. Isabella frequently orders food online because of her busy schedule, but because she did not grow up here and had a number of unpleasant experiences with restaurants, she makes sure to write reviews about her experience to help other students who may be in the same situation as her.</p>
