  			<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <br>
  			<p>Quebec is gradually reverting to life before the COVID-19 outbreak after dealing with the pandemic for almost three years. It is impossible to overlook the aftereffects of COVID-19 and how they continue to affect us even as COVID-19 nears its end. The people of Quebec have observed that many products have grown more expensive due to inflation as they attempt to get their lives back to normal after the pandemic. In an attempt to lessen the negative effects of high inflation, the government of Quebec has recruited our team to create an app for the restaurant "Flavors", which is situated in the center of downtown and is close to Concordia University. After extensive investigation and analysis of the effects of inflation, it was determined that the ideal solution would be an addition of a cashback feature to the app.</p>

  			<p>The user personas were divided into three groups based on the research information our team gathered to better understand the demands of the users. Following a thorough examination of each group, we found that user requirements vary greatly depending on each person's priorities, ambitions, skills, and frustration.</p>

                  <p><b>Persona #1:</b> Our first persona, Isabella Hunter, is a hard-working employee who spends the majority of her time at her office located downtown. Isabella loves sitting and talking with her friends, as she isn’t able to do that often with her demanding work schedule. Isabella is an adamant believer that food brings people together and enjoys bonding with friends and family over a delicious meal. Isabella aims to treat her friends and family every so often by placing big orders from an online delivery app, in hopes of earning rewards.</p>
                  <p><b>Persona #2:</b> The second persona, Martins James, works at a local accounting firm and because of his hectic and unpredictable schedule, meal planning isn’t his priority. Martins is very selective of the food he eats, and he frequently finds himself meticulously reviewing ratings before placing any orders. As an accountant, Martins tends to be frugal when spending his own money, hence, he would like to save money on his orders.</p>
                  <p><b>Persona #3:</b> Finally, our third persona is Olivia Ahmet. Olivia is an international student from Turkey who is currently completing her second year of Software Engineering at Concordia University. Olivia is a full-time student, who spends a majority of her time attending lectures and commuting to school. As a result, Olivia finds adjusting to life in Canada challenging because she has no family to rely on and must cook and care for herself. Olivia frequently orders food online because of her busy schedule, but because she did not grow up here and had a number of unpleasant experiences with restaurants, she makes sure to write reviews about her experience to help other students who may be in the same situation as her.</p>

  			<h2>User Goals</h2>
        <br>
  			<p>It is crucial to comprehend customer objectives because they heavily influence the outcome of the design. Our team was able to identify several key user requirements by using user personas and surveys. Since the target audience consists primarily of students and office professionals who are both extremely busy and on a tight budget, especially in the aftermath of the pandemic, their key objectives while dining out were the following:</p>
			<ol>
			  <li>Save money while eating out at restaurants</li>
 			 <li>Read and submit reviews about past customers' experiences.</li>
			</ol>  
                  <p>While keeping these objectives in mind at all times, it was determined that the best features to include would be cashback and a review component to satisfy user needs. </p>

  		<section id="user-journey">
          <center>
  			<h2>User Journey</h2>
        <br>
  			<p>The next step was to construct a user journey map in order to imagine the application from the perspective of the user and to describe how they interacted with it. This method allows us to understand the users' feelings at every stage of the application's use, allowing us to identify and improve on features that could suit their needs. The experience of Martins James, one of our user personas, is depicted in the journey map below.<br>We may conclude from this user journey that Martins was annoyed by the outrageous prices and angry that there were no reviews available. We decided that our application should offer cashback to customers and also make reviews available for all options on the menu. </p>
